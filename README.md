# CodeReview-flow
Our flow:

1. Download files from latest episode.
2. Make new repository, for example CodeReview-PHP-1
3. Clone Repository.
3. Add files to Repository (original code on branch master)
4. Create new branch push 
5. Push new branch.
6. Write something about bad practices, tell about changes. ( Nice if you put the same in README.MD ) Use Markdown!
