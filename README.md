# CodeReview-flow
Our flow:

1. Download files from latest episode.
2. Make new repository, for example CodeReview-PHP-1
3. Clone Repository.
3. Add files to Repository
4. Create new branch
5. Commit and push to remote
6. Create PR and write something about bad practices, tell about changes. ( Nice if you put the same in README.MD ) Use Markdown!
7. Merge
